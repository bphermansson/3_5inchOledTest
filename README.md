A test project to drive a 3.5" ILI9486-based LCD with a Raspberry Pi Pico W. 
This project uses Bodmer's LCD library, https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI
and a Noname LCD, http://www.lcdwiki.com/3.5inch_Arduino_Display-Mega2560
I can not recommend this display as you have to connect it with 16 bits parallell cables,
this means over 20 cables between the display and the Pico when power and control pins are added.
